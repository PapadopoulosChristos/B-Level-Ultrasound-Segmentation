Abstract

Day by day more and more research is being published in the biomedical image section, on segmentation, particle localization, categorization. In the field of fetal ultrasound many researchers have dedicated their studies and dozens of papers have been published in recent years, as and the rapid progress of information technology has helped the field of study. 

The aim of this thesis is, in the first part, the study of research projects with a specific field of application prenatal ultrasound level B screening. As a result of this literature review a summary of data on which techniques are used in the analysis of the fetal image has emerged, the type of data set used, the anatomical regions investigated in each study. Have some useful conclusions been drawn about the most widespread techniques for applying machine learning and deep learning, in order to help young researchers who are going to work in this field of study.

The second part of the thesis focuses on the application of a deep learning network for the identification and recognition of vital organs in fetal imaging. More specifically, the selection and use of a Unet++ network was preceded by a literature review, then training of the network with application to an open database of fetal ultrasound images. The final objective was to apply the Unet++ network to a private clinic database to extract conclusions about the native population of locality, and study the results obtained. 

The results obtained by the research using the Unet++ network are to segment part of the images given as input, and in a large number of the segmented images ultrasound, he was able to identify the region of interest. For further study as it may help in the segmentation of fetus vital organs.


Our extended corpus, Unet++ archtecture and pipeline framework are all open
